# hello-world
Github.com's tutorial repository: used as a testbed, playground, and sometimes graveyard for in-progress projects and miscellany files.

This repository was originally created to familiarize myself with Github's web repository interface.
Any files placed into this repository will most likely be placed here because they have nowhere else to go or are not part of a full project necessitating its own whole repository. It will be used as a miscellany file storage area, a misc. code testbed, and possibly even a kind of project graveyard for currently abandoned projects. This is done to keep the repository list clean and free of loose ends and half baked projects.
